### **Classifying Images of Cats and Dogs with SVM**

Welcome to the repository for my **third internship project** at **Prodigy InfoTech**! This project focuses on implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from a Kaggle dataset.

## **Project Overview**

This project is a part of my Machine Learning internship, where I applied SVM for image classification. The goal is to distinguish between images of cats and dogs, showcasing the use of SVM in handling image data and providing insights into model performance.

## **Google Colab Notebook**

All work for this project is documented in a Google Colab notebook named [`ProdigyInfoTech_ML_Task_03.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u7y_3EwCCigD4r3CwvmLoctuLY4U4sSH?usp=sharing). The notebook includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps for image extraction, resizing, and scaling.
- **Model Implementation:** Building and training an SVM model for image classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy and loss.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and plots to illustrate model performance and predictions.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes image extraction, resizing, and scaling.
- **Model Implementation:** Uses SVM for binary classification of cat and dog images.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization:** Plots to visualize model performance and predictions.

## **Data Sources**

The dataset used in this project is the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) from Kaggle.

To download the dataset, use the following code in your Colab notebook:

```python
!kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats
```

## **Installation & Usage**

To view and run the project:

1. Open the Colab notebook: [`ProdigyInfoTech_ML_Task_03.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s9yqrUiRpQJLfUJrBJz8kPIzERBZktWZ?usp=sharing).
2. Run each cell to execute the code and see the results.

## **Results & Discussion**

The SVM model effectively classifies images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. The project highlights the power of SVM in image classification tasks and the importance of proper preprocessing.

## **Future Work**

Future improvements may include experimenting with more advanced classification algorithms and enhancing image preprocessing techniques to further boost accuracy.
